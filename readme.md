### uno-rs  
A Rust re-implementation of [dashaw92/Uno](https://github.com/dashaw92/Uno)  

This library implements all the basic Uno card game functionality.  
It is left up to the implementor of the interface to add niceties.  
A very basic game interface can be seen in [./src/bin/game.rs](./src/bin/game.rs)
